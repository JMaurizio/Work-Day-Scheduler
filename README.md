# Work Day Scheduler

Fully functioning work day scheduler.  When a text is entered in the time block and the lock button is clicked the text is saved to local storage.  When the page is refreshed as long as the items were saved to local storage they will persist.  I did take some creative liberties in my blockColor function and istead of using the given classes i choose to experiment with adding CSS properties through jQuery.  However the fuction itself could easily be switch to the classes if need be.  Attached below are some screenshots of the application and a link to the deployed application itself.
